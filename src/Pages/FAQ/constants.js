We believe that Cambodian Art and culture is truly incomparable with any other culture as demonstrated by the Angkor period and “Pearl of Asia” title held in the 1950/60’s. With sales of traditional art falling off due to Covid and physical gallery visits diminishing , NFT’s have provided an epochal opportunity for artists to generate not only new forms of revenue from their works old and new; but also the ability to utilize new technologies and techniques whilst securing royalties on all future sales. Krama will be providing signature collections including Legacy Artists, Urban Arts, Digital Art and also CSR arts and educational collections created in line with our FSA ( Full Steam Ahead) project with CCF ( Cambodian Children’s Fund) celebrating the 90th anniversary of Royal Train Square.
